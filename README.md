# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
Our client Louiseâ€™s play *Fever* came close to its Kickstarter fundraising goal. Louise would like to know how other fundraising campaignes went based on their launch dates and funding goals.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
In order to look at the data by launch date, it is necessary to convert the time to a more easily readable format.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset? 
- 
One of the limitations of this analysis is that there was no connections made directly about length of the campaigns. It is possible that a longer campaign is more likely to be funded, it would be useful to create a gragh to see this visually.


- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
