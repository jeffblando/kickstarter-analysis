# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
Our client Louiseâ€™s play *Fever* came close to its Kickstarter fundraising goal. Louise would like to know how other fundraising campaigns went based on their launch dates and funding goals.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
One of the challenges faced with doing this analysis was learning how to use unfamilar functions of excel. In order to analyze  the data in an efficient way required the use of functions such as the year conversion from epoc to gregorian and coutifs, as well as learning to use pivot tables to filter the data.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

One of the limitations of this analysis is that we did not fully utilize all the data we were given. There were no connections made directly about length of the campaigns. It is possible that a longer campaign is more likely to be funded.  We also did not look at whether or not using the spotlight feature had any effect of the success of a campaign. A testable hypothesis would be that using the spotlight feature will result in a successful campaign. One other thing not considered in this analysis was whether or not the campaign was included as a staff pick. if youwere to include all the criteria mentioned above into account, a broader and more inclusive analysis would be acheived and more precise conclusions could be derived.
